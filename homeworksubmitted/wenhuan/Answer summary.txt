Thanks for you lecture, it's interesting and informative. Here I attached my R code and figure outputs for assignment1. Below I summaried my observations and output notes.

1. Assignment Observations
I conducted the assignment using four different levels of sigma (Ïƒ), specifically sd=3,6,9,18\text{sd} = 3, 6, 9, 18sd=3,6,9,18.
For each level, I performed 10 replications, resulting in a total of 8 plots (single draw and 10 replicates for each sigma).
Output filenames: parameter_estimates_sd3(6,9,18).tiff, and their respective 10-replication versions.

Findings:
For sd=18, 10 replications clearly allowed parameter estimates to stabilize more quickly compared to a single draw.
For sd<18, no significant difference was observed between a single draw and 10 replications in terms of stability.

2. Challenge Observations

Challenge A: Dummy Variable Model
I implemented a dummy variable approach for categorical treatment levels.
Output filename: parameter_estimates_dummy_variable.tiff.

Findings:
With 10 replicates, parameter estimates achieved stability faster compared to using a single model.


Challenge B: Full Factorial Model with Two Treatments
I implemented a full factorial model involving two treatments.
Output filenames: parameter_estimates_full_factorial.tiff and its replicates.

Findings:
For the two-treatment model, there was no obvious difference in stability between a single sample and 10 replicates.


Challenge C: Uncertainty Analysis
I analyzed parameter uncertainty by extracting 50% posterior uncertainty intervals.
Output filename: uncertainty_intervals.tiff.

Findings:
Parameters related to the intercept and categorical variables exhibited larger uncertainty.
This was consistent across the two-treatment model, where terms involving continuous variables showed smaller uncertainty.
when the sample size> 30 or 40, 10 replcates lower uncertainty than single sample, and sd18 started showing lower uncertainty than sd9.
