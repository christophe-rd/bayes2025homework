Summary

The dataset I used for this homework is focused on carnivore teeth across different species. 
Initially, my goal was to examine whether higher latitudes are associated with longer teeth. 
However, this analysis did not reveal a significant relationship. As an alternative, I investigated
 the relationship between PM4 (premolar length) and CsupL (canine length) across species. This analysis 
proved meaningful, as it demonstrated how these two types of teeth co-evolve and how their relationships
 differ across species (output: initial_model_CsupL_PM4.tiff).Because the dataset contained numerous 
species, I eventually grouped them by families to simplify the comparisons.





Step 1: Model Development
To create the model, I started with an initial hierarchical Bayesian model (partial_pooling.stan). 
This model accounted for partial pooling across species (or families), allowing both intercepts and 
slopes to vary by group. I designed this model because I lacked prior knowledge about carnivore teeth 
evolution and wanted a flexible framework to explore potential relationships.

Step 2: Simulated Data and Priors Check
I generated test data and simulated them to ensure that my model could recover known parameters.
 These simulations demonstrated that the model worked as intended. I also performed prior predictive checks, 
and the priors were shown to conform well to reality, offering a reasonable balance between flexibility and constraint.

Step 4: Fitting the Model to Empirical Data
I applied the model to the empirical data and analyzed the relationships between PM4 and CsupL 
across families. The results showed good model performance, with convergence diagnostics indicating no 
divergences, R-hat values close to 1, and high effective sample sizes.

Step 5: Retrodictive (Posterior Predictive) Checks
To assess the fit of the model to the empirical data, I performed retrodictive checks. This included both:

Visualizations generated using shinystan (outputs: Shinyshan result_retrodictive.JPG and Shinyshan result_retrodictive_estimate.JPG).
Coding posterior predictive checks in R, where I visualized the slopes and posterior predictions of ypred (outputs: PosteriorPredCheck_slope.tiff).
The posterior predictive checks showed that the model fit the data well, and the slope comparisons provided meaningful insights into 
how families of carnivores differ in the relationship between PM4 and CsupL.
